My own website made with Jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com) & Compass theme (Compass is a Jekyll theme designed by Eduardo Rubio https://github.com/excentris/compass).


### Development:

Build the site and make it available on a local server: `bundle exec jekyll serve`  

For publish on GitHub Pages just push the code on repo.

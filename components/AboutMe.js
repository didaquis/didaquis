			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>Hi, my name is Dídac and I'm a full stack web developer living halfway between Barcelona and Terrassa.</p>
			<p>I’m interested in creating beautiful projects with JavaScript using MERN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS).</p>
			<p>Previously, I worked at <a href="https://worksolutions.es" target="_blank" title="Worksolutions">Worksolutions</a> as developer (mostly PHP and MySQL) and I studied at <a href="http://www.skylabcoders.com/es" target="_blank" title="Skylab Coders Academy">Skylab Coders Academy</a>. I'm currently working on a medical project at <a href="http://ditec.es/es/" target="_blank" title="Ditec Comunicaciones">Ditec Comunicaciones</a>.</p>
			<p>In my spare time I like improving my skills in Linux and Git or just learn about Node.js, React, GraphQL or anything else. There are so many interesting things in this world, right?</p>
			<p>When I'm not in front of the computer, I'm probably doing some cool stuff with my Raspberry Pi or I’m out there just rock climbing!<br /><span className="smile-face">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</span></p>

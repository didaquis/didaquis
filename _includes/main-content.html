<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Dídac and I'm a full stack web developer living halfway between Barcelona and Terrassa.</p>
<p>I’m interested in creating beautiful projects with JavaScript using MERN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS).</p>
<p>Previously, I've been working at <a href="https://worksolutions.es" target="_blank" title="Worksolutions">Worksolutions</a> as a lead developer (mostly PHP and MySQL), but now I'm studying at <a href="http://www.skylabcoders.com/es" target="_blank" title="Skylab Coders Academy">Skylab Coders Academy</a>.</p>
<p>In my spare time I like improving my skills about Linux and Git or just learn about Jekyll, Electron, React or anything else. There are so many interesting things in this world, right?</p>
<p>When I'm not in front of the computer, I'm probably doing some cool stuff with my Raspberry Pi or I’m out there just rock climbing!<br><span style="white-space: nowrap; line-height: 220%;">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</span></p>

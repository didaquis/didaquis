<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Dídac and I'm a full stack web developer living halfway between Barcelona and Terrassa.</p>
<p>I’m interested in creating beautiful projects with JavaScript using MEAN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS).</p>
<p>I'm currently working at <a href="https://worksolutions.es" target="_blank" title="Worksolutions">Worksolutions</a> as a lead developer (mostly PHP & MySQL) and I'm also studying at <a href="http://www.skylabcoders.com/es" target="_blank" title="Skylab Coders Academy">Skylab Coders Academy</a>.</p>
<p>In my spare time I like improving my skills about Linux and Git or just learn about WordPress, PrestaShop, Jekyll, MantisBT, Twitter API or anything else. There are so many interesting things in this world, right?</p>
<p>When I'm not in front of the computer, I'm probably doing some cool stuff with my Raspberry Pi or I’m out there just rock climbing!<br><span style="white-space: nowrap; line-height: 220%;">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</span></p>
